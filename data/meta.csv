The European Environment Agency and United Nations Environment Programme estimate that 40-50 million tonnes of electrical equipment waste are produced each year globally. It's increasing three times faster than all other types of domestic waste. ""Across Africa, the technology market is predicted to grow by over 8% a year for the next three years. This is great news for the region, but comes at a cost. E-waste in Africa is growing 20% each year due to rising sales of electronic goods and legal and illegal imports of second hand and surplus equipment"", explains  Dr. Kirstie McIntyre, Head of Environmental Compliance at HP.  For most of sub-Saharan African countries, the lack of a sustainable e-waste management infrastructure means that e-waste is collected and recycled in crude methods, causing the release of toxic chemicals to the environment and putting those refurbishing and dismantling e-waste at risk. This is aggravated by the fact these countries usually have little e-waste legislation and no regulations to protect the health of e-waste workers.  In October 2011, HP opened the East African Computer Recycling Company (EACR) in Mombasa, Kenya, in partnership with Camara Education, an Education through ICT' NGO working with disadvantaged communities in Africa (see EACR intro by Ken Mbwaya, former CEO of HP Kenya). Kenya generates thousands of tonnes of electronic waste per year  waste that on the one hand can cause great harm to the environment, but on the other, can be used as a resource and an economic stimulus. EACR is operating Kenya's first e-waste recycling facility, operating to international health, safety and environmental standards and establishing a local, sustainable IT e-waste recycling industry. Until now, the facility received end-of-life IT from business and public sector customers, as well as from the informal sector, assessing the waste for refurbishment or recycling. EACR offers its workers advice on handling e-waste containing hazardous materials such as lead and cadmium. Robert Truscott, CEO of Reclaimed Appliances (UK) Ltd, took over EACR in January 2012. EACR recently changed name (same acronym, but computer' changed to compliant') due to broadened scope of e-waste recycled from IT to everything with a plug' as well as non-electronic waste (all types of plastics).  If EACR has been able to prove on a small scale that its concept for e-waste recycling can work and that it changes the habits of local waste pickers in a sustainable manner (see the min' 46 in this recent documentary from the Swiss TV), our goal is now to create a financially viable business and therefore scale it up. EACR will soon be relocated in a bigger facility in Nairobi, which will source its e-waste  from collection centers working with the informal sector and located all over the Kenyan territory. We firmly believe that e-waste management holds opportunities in skills transfer and revenue generation that can be turned into drivers for incorporating Africa's informal recycling networks into economically, ethically and environmentally sustainable systems. Training the informal sector to proper collection, dismantling and recycling of e-waste is thus key for Kenya to ""capitalize on revenue opportunities whilst ensuring e-waste management can operate as a self-sustaining system"", as Dr. Kirstie McIntyre puts it.",East African Compliant Recycling,,,,,,57.1428571,552,010.2307/25501737,"Kachwanya.com is a blogsite dedicated to Tech gadget reviews, Business IT news updates, Social Media management, and Startup discussions in Kenya and Africa.

Unlike traditional insurance covering large farms, the affordable Kilimo Salama model covers thousands of farmers with automated weather stations, local registration points and mobile technology. Insured farmers now continue to use improved inputs and rely less on food aid after poor weather ruins harvests.  There are over 4 million smallholder farming households in Kenya practicing rain-fed agriculture, a majority of whom can benefit from insurance. Our experience shows a realistic target uptake from this potential market should be around 10% of the value of production or inputs used. For food crops, total investment in inputs is $1B meaning $3.04M in fees annually. Total harvest values for the crops is $8.7B, meaning $24.4M in fees annually.  Over the past 3 years, Kilimo Salama has successfully developed a weather micro- insurance distribution channel using a mobile phone registration platform in over 80 village agricultural input stores, reaching 50,000+ resource-poor farmers in six drought-prone areas of Kenya. The insurance supports increased confidence to invest in certified inputs and facilitates improved crop production through extension services from partners.

Its original name was West African Graphic Company Limited. The company published its first newspaper, the Daily Graphic, On October 2, 1950, and followed it up in 1953 with the weekly Sunday Mirror, now called The Mirror.  The company later changed its name from West African Graphic Company Ltd to Ghana Graphic Company Ltd after the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain 1957 and changed its name to Ghana.  By an Act of Parliament the Government of Ghana acquired the company from its private owners in 1962. In 1971, the company became a statutory corporation through a legislative instrument  the Graphic Corporation Instrument, 1971, LI 709. This was in compliance with the Statutory Corporations Act, 1964 (Act 232). The company, therefore, became known as Graphic Corporation. In response to market demands, the company added Graphic Sports in 1985 and Graphic Showbiz in 1998 to its publications. In 1999, the company took advantage of the Statutory Corporations (Conversion to Companies) Act, 1993, Act 461, to change from a corporation to an autonomous private limited liability company under the companies Code, 1963, Act 179. This resulted in autonomy for the company. Also, as part of the change, the company renamed itself the Graphic Communications Group Ltd and redefined its vision to become a multimedia organisation. After becoming a limited liability, the company came up with four more publications: Junior Graphic (2000), Graphic Advertiser (2004), Graphic Nsempa (2007) and Graphic Business (2008). However, the company no longer publishes Graphic Advertiser and Graphic Nsempa. Throughout this period, the company kept improving on its print quality by buying the state-of-the-art press of the time. It started in 1950 with the letterpress printing technology, which was the printing technology available at the time. In 1976, the company installed the first web offset colour printing machine in Ghana. This was the semi-automatic Harris web offset press manufactured in the USA. The company bought two production lines. One was a four-unit press and the other a two-unit press. However, both could be set to work together if the company needed to print more pages at the same time. Again, in 1995 Graphic led the newspaper industry in Ghana with an upgraded version of the web offset colour machine, the Heidelberg Harris press.  In 2011, the company again changed its printing machine with the installation of the KBA Comet press, which was (and it still is) the first of its kind in Ghana. Alongside the installation of this printing machine, the company also switched from the printing technology that required the use of films to one that requires no film, which is technically called computer-to-plate (CTP).  The Graphic Communications Group Ltd has one subsidiary company called the G-Pak, which is into commercial printing of books, packaging materials and other printing products (See G-PAK profile).",Graphic Communications Group,,,,,,24.2424242,473,010.2307/456387,"MPawa is a blue-collar recruitment application that helps employers access a large pool of blue-collar workers.

Yet the patient experience is very much defined by flow, transportation, environmental services, and other support areas that have a significant effect on patient flow including a patient leaving without being seen and general clinic management. A patient's length of stay depends on effective patient's tracking software and orchestration of their resource plan of care. Length of stay, in turn, has a direct bearing on capacity management and, ultimately, clinic costs and revenues. When one goes to a healthcare centre, usually a paper file is opened, data about a patient entered, and filed in cabin.  The process is repeated next time you go back for treatment. Despite the fact that this can go on for several years, it's extremely difficult to make good use of data stored that way by clinician or researchers. A simple query such as number of female children seen in the last several years could take several days to get, moreover its accuracy may not be guaranteed. Consider a situation where by you visit one healthcare centre and next time go to another one if data is not stored electronically, there is no easy way of interlinking these centers to share patient's history.
