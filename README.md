# This is a browser I built to display the model from my paper "Social Entrepreneurship, Language, and Funding: Evidence from Tech Startups in Sub-Saharan Africa." It allows the user to browse the topic model of the African firms in my Crunchbase sample, as well as the relationship that the topic model has with the Social Orientation Score generated by Mechanical Turk raters.

The code for this project is heavily based on Andrew Goldstone's dfr browser [agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser]. Many thanks to him!
